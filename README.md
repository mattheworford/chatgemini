# ChatGemini

This repository contains a Python implementation of ChatGPT utilizing the Google Gemini library. ChatGPT is a conversational language model based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture developed by OpenAI. Google Gemini is a library for building and training large-scale deep learning models.

## Overview

ChatGPT is a conversational AI model capable of generating human-like responses given a prompt or input text. This repository provides an implementation of ChatGPT using the Google Gemini library, allowing users to leverage the power of Gemini for building and training their own conversational models.

## Features

- Implementation of ChatGPT using the Google Gemini library.
- Easy-to-use interface for generating responses from the trained ChatGPT model.
- Example scripts and notebooks demonstrating how to train and utilize the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Gemini library (installation instructions provided in the documentation)
- Additional dependencies as outlined in the `requirements.txt` file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatGPT-GoogleGemini.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd ChatGPT-GoogleGemini
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up the Google Gemini library and obtain necessary credentials or API keys.

## Usage

1. Training the Model:

   - Use provided data or your custom dataset to train the ChatGPT model.
   - Fine-tune the model using the `train.py` script, providing appropriate parameters and data paths.

2. Generating Responses:

   - Utilize the trained model to generate responses using the `generate.py` script or the provided Jupyter notebooks.

3. Integration:
   - Integrate the trained model into your application or system for various conversational use cases.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation and examples are provided in the `docs` directory. Refer to the documentation for information on installation, usage, training the model, and generating responses.
